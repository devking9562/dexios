## Dexios

Dexios is a fast, secure, and open source command-line encryption tool. It's written entirely in Rust and prioritises security, performance and convenience the most. It uses modern cryptographic functions, and audited backends to ensure the safety and integrity of your data. It's extremely easy to use Dexios before uploading your files to a cloud service, to ensure that no prying eyes can read them.

You can install Dexios through cargo, with

`cargo install dexios`
