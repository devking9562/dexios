## Dexios - What is it?

Dexios is a fast, secure, and open source command-line encryption tool. It's written entirely in Rust and prioritises security, performance and convenience the most.

It's extremely easy to use Dexios before uploading your files to a cloud service, to ensure that no prying eyes can read them.

You can install Dexios through cargo, with

`cargo install dexios`
